## 🔤 Passwords Created and Evaluation

| Password             | Score (%) | Time to Crack               | Feedback                                  |
|----------------------|-----------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `Pass123`            | 45%       | Less than 1 second          | Too short, lacks complexity               |
| `Winter!2025`        | 67%       | About 3 minutes             | Fair; use more symbols or length          |
| `Jx@9qpT#vU12`       | 90%       | 200 years                   | Strong; good complexity and length        |
| `1Love!MyC@tForever` | 95%       | 300+ trillion years         | Excellent; long passphrase, very secure   |
| `G@laxy#42!Zz_`      | 92%       | 1000+ years                 | Strong; well-balanced use of characters   |

## 📚 What Makes a Password Strong?

A strong password typically:
- Has at least 12 characters
- Includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Avoids common words or predictable patterns
- Is not reused across multiple accounts

---

## 🧠 Tips Learned
- **Longer passwords** are harder to crack than short, complex ones.
- **Passphrases** (like `MyD0g!IsC00l2025`) are easier to remember and very strong.
- **Avoid dictionary words**, names, or keyboard patterns (`qwerty`, `12345`).
- **Symbols and numbers** increase entropy significantly.
- Using **two-factor authentication (2FA)** adds another layer of security.

## 🚨 Common Password Attacks

| Attack Type          | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Brute Force**      | Tries all possible combinations until the correct one is found. |
| **Dictionary Attack**| Uses lists of common passwords and words to guess. |
| **Credential Stuffing** | Reuses stolen passwords on multiple sites. |
